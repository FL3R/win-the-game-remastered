        #Invisible
        ### Sorry for the confusing name, but this means they're invisible to the AI, not you. Meaning, they won't get tangled up in any off-screen battles. Good idea for chars that are required for cutscenes. They will show up on screen, but hostile AI chars will overlook them.
        for i in classmates:
            i.invisible = True ##This code makes them ALL invisible at start. You can then change their invisible status when their required cutscenes are done. I am doing this becauase I want you to try and meet all the campaign chars before they start randomly killing each other off.

        ## The "god mode" for chars. They will win any AI battle against other players, except for the player character
