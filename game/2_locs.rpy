        ##################
        ## There are 2 types of locations, "grid" and "room". Grid is the general square of land that the map is divided into. Rooms can be inside of grids, or inside other rooms.
        ## The map system requires that you have a map of the entire game location and that it can be divided into squares.
        
        #Size of map grid
        grid_x = 7 #columns (letters)
        grid_y = 4 #rows (numbers)
        
        ##"GRID"
        # Letter - the grid letter, as written in quotations
        # Number - the grid number, as an integer
        # X - X position of the top left corner of the grid square on overall map image
        # Y - Y position of the top left corner of the grid square on overall map image
        # BG image - defined as an image somewhere else, name only
        # Ambience - a background sound specfic to this location; * in "sfx/*.ogg" (Required)
        # Landmark - name of a landmark in this grid, if it exists (optional)
        # Landmark X -  X postion of the landmark image on the overall map (required if there's a landmark)
        # Landmark Y - Y postion of the landmark image on the overall map (required if there's a landmark)
        # Items - list of items in this location (default: []  empty)

        ##"ROOM"
        # Name - What the player will see on the "Enter _____" button
        # Parent Location - where you can find this room. This is usually a grid location, but you can place rooms inside of room by setting the parent to a room that's previously defined
        # BG image - defined as an image somewhere else, name only
        # Ambience - a background sound specfic to this location; * in "sfx/*.ogg" (default: the sound of the parent, volume reduced)
        # Items - list of items in this location (default: []  empty)
        # Visibility - # between 1 and 10 that describes how obvious and attractive the room is to outsiders. The higher the number, the more likely a student will go into it. (default = 5)
        # Can Sleep? - Can the player sleep here? (default: False)
        # Enter SFX - Sound for entering this room; * in "sfx/*.ogg" (default is a door opening)    
        # Exit SFX  - Sound for leaving this room; * in "sfx/*.ogg" (default is a door closing)    
        # Exit Location  - Use this if, for some reason, you want the player to end up at a certain location when they exit instead of their technical parent location
